# About the SpaConference  submission process

Thanks to Nick Tune (@ntcoding) I submitted an EventStorming hands-on to
the SpaConference in 2018 

And what I discovered there is a completely transparent process .
Right from the start, you can see each and every one of the submissions.
And anyone can comment on the submissions.
This might sound scary, but all of the comments I have seen resolve around better submissions.

Then a few week before the final decision is made, the submission are frozen,
and anyone can again make a review.

This time it's more in depth review, not just comments, like classifying the submission,
wether it it's the SpaConference preffered format (workshop & hands-on)
Those review are not public at that moment, you just know that a certain number of people reviewed.

Once the review process is done , you get to see that actual reviews on you own submission;
wheteher it has been accepted or not!
This is an invaluable transparent process way better than 
"Sorry, You're not accepted, but try again next year"

I understand that for larger conference it's impossible to give personalized feedback.
But my guess is that the openess of this submission process must be scalable in some way.
