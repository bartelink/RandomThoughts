# Event Storming and Modeling

## Big Picture Level

Focus on the business (people)  
Mainly exploration sessions.  
Chaotic by design.  
There is no Scope.  
The format is flexible to adapt to the needs of the people.  
There should be discussions happening at all steps.

Timing : 1/2 day to 1 day, more if the problem space is really large.

### Goals

  * Discovery of the domain.
  * Have people discuss conflicting views of the problem space.
  * Discovery of the Problem Space *as is* , whole of it .
  * Visualize & understand the issues.
  * Discovery of the most important problem to solve.

### Steps

1. Invitations
2. Room Setup
3. Kick-Off   
    * What we're going to do  
	* Prepare them for the awkward type of workshop
4. Chaotic Exploration 	
    * Let the people work alone, don't seek consensus  
	* Iterate as needed.  
5. Enforce the timeline
    * Locally  
	* The whole  
    * iterate as needed  
6. People And Systems.
	* Who is doing what ?  
	* What is the systems (internal / externals)  
	* Only where needed  
	* Iterate as needed  
7. Explicit walk-through  
    * Let the people tell their stories to the group
    * iterate as needed
8. Problems & Opportunities
    * Look at the red stickies  
    * add "value" destruction & creation  
9. Pick the Right Problem
    * Arrow voting
10. Wrap up   


### Ingredients

* Large Meeting Room ( no chairs )
    * Huge Walls
* Paper Roll (50 meters)
* Flip chart (optional)
* Healthy snack & beverage
* People  
    * with questions
    * with answers
    * 1 or 2  facilitators  
	   * ideally externals (they are allowed to ask stupid questions)
	   * One is observing only & eventually takes over when the 1st one is exhausted  
* lot's of (whiteboards) markers
* Stickies
    * Orange (squared , 500 )
	* Blue (200)
	* Purple (200)
	* Pink (100)
	* Yellow (small, 200)
	* Arrows
	* ( green (100) )
	* ( pale yellow (100))

## Process / System Design Level

Focus on the Solution.  
Less chaotic.  
Limited Scope.  
Precision required.
Less people involved.  
This one is done when all
    * hotspots are addressed   
    * path are complete
    * people are happy
    * people want to implement it.

Timing : 1/2 day  more if the problem is really large.

### Goals

 * Get into the details of the problem discovered during the Big Picture
 * Explore different possible solutions
 * Find an accepted agreement the solution that will be implemented in the solution space

### Steps
1. Explore the problem that need solving  
2. Iterate over different solutions  
    * Follow the color coding   
        * people => command => Entity => Event   
        * people => Command => ext. system => Event  
        * event => read model => people  
        * event => policy => command   
    * draw mock-ups where needed
    * check the "value" creation / destruction  
    * Address hotspots
3. Agree on "best" solution  

### Ingredients
* Large Meeting Room ( no chairs )
    * Huge Walls
* Paper Roll (50 meters)
* A successful Big Picture EventStorming
* Flip chart (optional)
* Healthy snack & beverage
* People  
    * the relevant business experts
    * the development team
    * 1 or 2  facilitators  
* lot's of (whiteboards) markers
* Stickies
    * Orange (squared , 300 )
    * Blue (300)
    * Purple (200)
    * Pink (rectangular, 100)
    * Lilac  (200)
    * Yellow (small, 200 )
    * Green (squared, 100) )
    * Pale yellow (rectangular, 100)

## Event Modelling

Focus on the Solution.  
Less chaotic.  
Limited Scope.  
Precision required.
Less people involved.  
This one is done when all
    * hotspots are addressed   
    * path are complete
    * people are happy
    * people want to implement it.

Timing : 1/2 day to 1 day.


### Goals

  * Get into the details of the problem discovered during the Big Picture
  * Find an accepted agreement the solution that will be implemented
  * Define chunk of independent work items.

### Steps

1. Brainstorm the Events
2. Create a story (timeline)
3. Wireframes / mockups
    * on top , swinlane per user
4. Inputs  (commands)
5. Outputs (readmodels)
6. Conway's law
    * events in swimlanes
7. Elaborate Scenario's
    * State changes, commands
        * given - when - then
        * (event, event)=> (command) => (event)
    * State views, read models given - then : state:
        * given - then
        * (event, event) => (read models)
    * External state Input
        * given - when - then
        * (event, event)=> (command) => (event)
    * External state output s
        * given - when - then
        * (read model)=> (command) => (event)

### Ingredients
* Large Meeting Room ( no chairs )
    * Huge Walls , if they are writable , the better
* Paper Roll (50 meters)
* A successful Big Picture or Design Level EventStorming
* Flip chart (optional)
* Healthy snack & beverage
* People  
    * the relevant business experts
    * the development team
    * 1 or 2  facilitators  
* lot's of (whiteboards) markers
* Stickies
  * Orange (squared , 300 )
  * Blue (squared ,300)
  * Green (squared, 300) )
  * Yellow (rectangular, 100)  
  * Pink (rectangular, 100)
  * Lilac  (200)
  * Pale yellow (rectangular, 100) (for the )
* A4 paper sheet (100)

## Dogmatic Color Coding  

| Color         | Concept   |  
| ---           | ---       |  
| Orange        | Event     |  
| Blue          | Command   |
| Green         | Read Model|
| Yellow        | Entity    |
| small Yellow  | People    |
| Pink          | System    |
| Lilac         | Policy    |
| Purple/Red    | Hotspot   |
