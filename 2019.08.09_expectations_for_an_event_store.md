# Expections 


What I expect from some system that allows to store streams of events,  
intended to be used in an eventsourced system.

- ability to create streams.
- ability to use optimistic locking on stream level
- ability to write a batch of events in one stream atomically and durably
- ability to read events from one stream
- ability to read all events in the store ( the so called "$all" stream)
- ability to read forward and backward
- ability to read from some position in a stream or from the "$all" stream
- ability to remove events before some position or  time
- abitlity to have subscription (though I might consider it a bonus)


other functionalities are bonus , some bonuses are evil


Examples of evil bonuses  
- Transactional write on multiple streams:
  - you can avoid it by carefully designing your streams
  
- allowing to participate in Distributed Transactions
  - e.g. writing to a stream and updating a read model in another storage atomically
